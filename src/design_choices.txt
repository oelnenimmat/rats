- Voxels are always cubes
- chunk is 1 world unit
	-> voxels_in_chunk define resolution


Game is experience importanted game
	-> nuances and feelings come first
	-> they dictate the world etc.
	-> input, controls, interface etc. are created to complement those
		- care must be taken, since its a video game and controls are 
		users primary way of experiencing it

Avoid grind at all cost
Make game playful by making it easy to get big impact
	-> e.g. rats. move a little, a ton of rats react
	-> characters react like in old school cartoons instead of like in videogames

PLAYFULNESS!!!
