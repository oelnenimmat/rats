Current goal

Think about allocation and deallocation
	- in game and in editor
	- in game: mostly no need to reaallocate ever
	- in editor: many times need to allocate

	--> editor: set up capacities to be enforced, but alloc with malloc in editor
	--> game: allocate big chunk at start, use that

Mouse interaction with scene
	- translation gizmos
	- voxel thing edit
