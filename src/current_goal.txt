Current goal



Make player able to walk to different islands etc.
	- island creation and rendering properly from island/world settings
	- runtime recreation of those
	- collision now works with generated terrain, against noise field
		-> make also consider island bounds






collision
	-> walls etc
	-> falling when not supported by ground

Falling down, multiple islands, toggle rendering of islands

clouds
	- assets from magicavoxel

separate voxel data from chunk map
	-> chunk map only has "pointers" to data
	-> chunk map is dense
	-> voxel data is sparse, unordered and in a different buffer



Render voxel maps like meshes -> separate transform and map
	-> render a struct with transform and map index
